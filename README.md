TableView contains 1000 elements that can be moved and deleted.
The order in which the icons are displayed is fixed (icon 11 is the same as icon 1). Changes only when elements are moved or removed.

Clicking on a cell opens a second screen that displays:

The picture of the selected element, enlarged by 100% and located in the center of the screen

Text fields with a description of the selected item, located under the picture (added to UIStackView)
